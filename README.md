# 🚀 React Hooks Showcase & CRUD Demo 🚀

Welcome to the **React Hooks Showcase & CRUD Demo**\! This isn't just another simple app; it's a hands-on journey through some of React's most powerful features. Whether you're a beginner getting to grips with React or an experienced dev looking for a quick refresher, this project has something for you.

This interactive application provides live, visual feedback on how **`useMemo`** and **`useCallback`** optimize performance, alongside a fully functional **CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete)** interface.

-----

## ✨ Features

This application is split into three distinct, easy-to-understand modules:

  * ### **📝 Full CRUD Functionality**

      * **Create**: Add new users to your list with a clean and simple form.
      * **Read**: Instantly see your list of users displayed on the page.
      * **Update & Delete**: (Coming Soon\!) Functionality to edit and remove users from the list.

  * ### **🔄 `useCallback` Demo**

    An interactive sandbox to understand how `useCallback` prevents unnecessary re-renders by memoizing functions. Watch the render count and see the magic for yourself\!

  * ### **⚙️ `useMemo` Demo**

    A live demonstration of how `useMemo` can supercharge your application by memoizing expensive, heavy calculations and avoiding redundant computations.

-----

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This project is built with modern web technologies to ensure a smooth and efficient developer experience.

  * **React.js**: For building the user interface.
  * **JavaScript (ES6+)**: The core language of the application.
  * **HTML5 & CSS3**: For structure and styling.
